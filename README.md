# Installation

Assuming you have all system dependencies in place, do this:

* Put everything from the `scripts` directory into any directory in your PATH.
* Run `. jamaratus` at your command line.  There is a space after that dot!
* Run `line1 Hello` to get the following output, where the line should fit your screen precisely:

```
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Hello
--
```

* In `scripts`, note the names of the `_*.sh` files.
* The commands are the string between the `_` and `.sh`.
* Run those and see how they work.

# Use Within Scripts

If things are working from the command line, do this:

* Put the following string at the top of any shell script:

    . jamaratus

Then use the commands within the script just as you would at the command line.
